# Goverment-of-unique-id-genration
Government unique ID generation is an application-based system for improving the current situation regarding the documents. It provides a single unique ID to every person so that he/she can easily access all the documents with that single ID, every person from child to old can use it.
The main objective Is to make the all documents safely and the mainly people can access their documents anytime.so we are making website in which in frontend we can use HTML/CSS/JS ,backend as python and MySql and server side language as PHP.So we are also adding the others features than documents and security also plays an important role in our projects 

The above system will work in the following ways:
i) Users have to login or signup in the application.
ii) The users will select any one documents present on the dashboard.
iii) On Selecting the document, the full details of the document will be displayed.
iv)Users can download the documents, if they have use of it.
v)All the government  big institutions, offices for different department accounts are also made in the application, so that users has any problem then they can directly contact with it.
vi) Making of group for submitting a documents to a single authorization is also possible in the application.
Government unique ID generation is a system that provides an embedded system. Currently there is no application which allows people who lose their documents to reapply or retrieve it, as soon as possible. Currently people go to the nearest government office or police station to apply for an FIR of lost documents but there is not enough staff or the system server is down. Problems like above are common occurrence. So, the locals with similar problem have no one to help to complete their work of government. Current system does not provide the way of getting lost document and if we want document at any particular instance then also the process is hard. The current system does not provide an embedded system where they can store all the professional and government documents at all one place confidentially.
Currently, the system uses various different IDs for various task. You may have voter id for sole purpose of voting. Ration card for only getting ration. You can store all these ids in one place such as Digi locker. However, using various ids may get confusing and hectic to manage. Thus the proposed system removes such hindrances and provides a stable alternative.
